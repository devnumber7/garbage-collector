We are going to write a simple mark and sweep algo. 
Idea is Simple:
First Step: Mark
Second Step: Sweep

LOL OK but fr basically the idea is that basically you flip all the objects that are reachable (aka marking )
and then delete the one that were not flipped , that'd indicate that they are unreachable ( aka sweeping)

THATS ABOUT IT.
 SEE TO BE FAMOUS IN CS DONT FIND OBSCURE STUFF. 
 JUST FIND THE MOST OBVIOUS NO-SHIT SHERLOCK IDEA
